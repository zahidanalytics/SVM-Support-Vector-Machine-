## 2. Cancer Classification (SVM on Breast Cancer Dataset)

**Description**  
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that distinguishes between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors using the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project demonstrates how SVM can find the optimal separating hyperplane in high-dimensional data.

**Key Features**
- Data cleaning and normalization  
- Mathematical explanation of SVM and the kernel trick  
- Implementation of linear and RBF kernels  
- Model performance comparison with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Dataset:** [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
